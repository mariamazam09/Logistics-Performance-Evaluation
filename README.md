## Introduction  
Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce integrator that connects small businesses to marketplaces and handles logistics. By analyzing Olist’s public dataset, we can assess logistics performance, order delivery, freight costs, and customer satisfaction; critical factors for e-commerce efficiency and competitiveness.

## Scenario  
The client , a growing e-commerce platform , requested a comprehensive logistics performance analysis to evaluate the efficiency of its current delivery partner. The goal is to identify key factors impacting delivery delays, shipping costs, and fulfillment times, to support renewal decisions and optimize logistics operations statement.


## Objectives  
1. Calculate delivery times (e.g., order approved → shipped → delivered)  
2. Analyze freight costs relative to order value or weight  
3. Map geolocation data to identify regions with logistic delays  
4. Provide actionable recommendations to improve delivery reliability and cost efficiency

## Dataset Overview

## Recommendations 
- Optimize logistics by identifying and rerouting shipments for regions with repeated delivery delays.  
- Negotiate freight partnerships or use regional hubs to reduce cost for high-distance orders.  


## Limitations
- The dataset spans orders from **2016–2018**, which may not reflect current operational realities.  
- Customer reviews may not always mention delivery delay explicitly, making sentiment attribution imperfect.  
- Freight cost data may not include all cost components (e.g., handling, returns).
